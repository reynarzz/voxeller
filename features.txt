-Export fbx and obj [Done]
-Export convert info as json .txt (num of meshes, colors count, frames, meshes names, etc...)
-Single and multi threaded processing, fully thread safe library.
-Cull faces that a "virtual camera" (manipulated by user) can't see
-If user decides to fully merge all meshes into one, also ask user if wants to remove hidden faces

[#Voxeller lib]
-Libs for Unity, full package (Custom importer for .vox)
-C# bindings
-C++ shared lib (Windows, Macos, Android, IOS, Linux), multiple compilers. (Clang, MSVC, MinGW)

[#Editor]
-Single executable, no dependencies (Release)
-Platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux

[#Fix to publish]
-Faces winding problem?
-Translation off by one voxel.

[#Publishing]
Publishing consist of 3 types, so we can sell components separatelly
   1:Complete:
	This contains the editor (single file exe), and all the libraries (shared) for different compilers: windows, mac, android, ios, linux
   2:Editor:
        Just the editor executable, single file, without dependencies.
   3:Libraries:
        All the libraries (shared), windows, mac, android, ios, linux. All for different compilers.


For unity, in windows I have to compile the libraries with the right MSVC versions:
	MSVC 2017 toolset for Unity 2019.x, 
	MSVC 2019 toolset for Unity 2020+
